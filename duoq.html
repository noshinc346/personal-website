									<h4>Starting Developement</h4>
									<p>
										The backend of our social media app, designed to connect gamers with their ideal duo partners, was meticulously crafted using Django and Python, demonstrating our proficiency with this powerful stack. We structured the backend into two distinct Django applications: a users app and a games app. The users app handles all aspects of user authentication, profile management, and social interactions, utilizing Django's robust authentication framework and extending it with custom functionalities to meet our specific needs. The games app manages game-related data, including game listings, match history, and user game preferences.									</p>

								<div class="para-content">
									<h4>Profile Creation</h4>
									<p>
										Use of Django signals to automate the creation and saving of related models. Specifically, it ensures that whenever a new user is created, a corresponding profile and preference are automatically generated. By using the @receiver decorator with the post_save signal, the create_profile and save_profile functions are triggered after a User instance is saved, ensuring the profile is created and saved.

									<h4>Setting up Database & Models ðŸ’»</h4>
									<p>
										TouchStone's backend, built with Django and Python, ensures robust performance and scalability. Using Django's framework, we manage database models, API views, and serializers efficiently. Our backend supports various functionalities such as Braille, words, and phrases management, with advanced search and filtering capabilities.

									<h4>Coding Front End with React / API calls / Integration ðŸ“ž</h4>
									<p>
										We chose Vite/React for our front-end to utilize its rapid development features, such as fast refresh and optimized build times. This technology aligns with our goal to implement a modular and efficient development environment, perfectly suited for adhering to the UX/UI team's Figma designs.

									<h4>Coding Front End with React</h4>
									<p>
										The MatchingPage component enhances user interaction by enabling seamless profile matching in our social media app for gamers. Upon loading, it fetches and displays a list of potential matches, excluding profiles the user has already matched with. Users can view and interact with these profiles, deciding whether to initiate a match. When a user selects a match, the component checks if a mutual match already exists; if so, it updates the match status to indicate reciprocity. If no prior match exists, it creates a new match record. The component also dynamically updates the displayed profile, ensuring users can effortlessly navigate through potential matches.									</p>

							<h2 class="duo-section-title">Challenges</h2>
							<h2 style="text-align: center;">ðŸ˜¤</h2>
							<h4>Match Logic</h4>
							<p>We wanted to ensure that users are only officially matched when both parties express mutual interest, keeping other match 
								requests pending until confirmed. We had to build the logic into the front and back end to ensure that the match 
								data remains consistent when reciprocated - i.e., if a match is reciprocated, then neither user should see their 
								matched user pop up when they are trying to find a new match AND if a user clicks on "match" and then later the 
								other user clicks on "match", we needed to ensure a pop-up message was returned and then, the user was added to their matches page.</p>
							<p>
								Due to the dynamic nature of the page (changing every time you hit skip or match), it was difficult to find a way to 
								easily create a matching algo without adjusting both the front and back end (which came with its one set of issues).

							<h4>Chat Feature (In Progress)</h4>
							<p>
								As part of our ongoing efforts to enhance user interaction and connectivity, we are excited to introduce a real-time chat feature in our social media app designed for gamers seeking their next duo partner. This feature will enable users to engage in seamless, instant messaging, fostering stronger connections and more dynamic communication within the community. Leveraging WebSocket technology, the chat functionality will provide low-latency, bi-directional communication, ensuring that messages are delivered instantly and reliably. The backend implementation will be managed using Django Channels, which will allow us to handle multiple concurrent connections efficiently. 
							</p>
							
							<h4>Newsletter Page</h4>
							<p>We plan to introduce a comprehensive newsletter feature. This will be handled through our Django backend, leveraging its robust framework to manage and distribute content efficiently. The newsletter page will allow users to subscribe and receive regular updates, news, and featured articles directly to their inbox. On the server side, we will utilize Djangoâ€™s powerful admin interface to manage newsletter posts and articles. This integration will enable administrators to easily create, edit, and schedule content, ensuring timely and relevant updates for our users.
