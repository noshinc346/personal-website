							<p>Jot is a personalized, versatile logger application crafted specifically for Gen Z. It is designed to accommodate their unique preferences for tracking mental health, social experiences, and daily events.</p>
							<h4>Inspiration</h4>
								<p>
									The initial vision for Jot was to create an application that supports mental health tracking. However, we envisioned a broader scope, allowing for a space where any thought, experience, or burst of creativity could be captured.</p>
									<p>Our app enables users to "Jot" down anything from a brilliant movie idea to a memorable or even challenging day, enhancing personal reflection and data visualization over time.</p>
									<p>Observing that Gen Z often logs their moments using basic notes apps or uses specific apps like sobriety trackers, we were inspired to develop a more comprehensive logger app. Jot not only captures these moments but also organizes and generates insightful data automatically.</p>

									</p>							
								<h4>What it does</h4>
								<p>	
									Our app is a user-centric, personalized logger, tailored to your unique lifestyle. You can create categories for different aspects of your life, like 'Social' or 'Stupid Moments', and within these, tally your experiencesâ€”like the number of dates you've been on or times you've said something you regret. It's not just about counting; it's about reflecting on these instances in a light-hearted or serious manner, offering you a space to truly understand the journey you're on.
									You can reflect on these moments by visiting the data page on the specific category you want to view.
								</p>
							<h3>User Story</h3>
							<p>
								As a user, I want to log instances of specific emotions and the reasons behind them so that I can track these occurrences and review the overall results over time.

										The registration form requires essential information only, including name, email, and 
										password, making the sign-up process quick and straightforward. Prominent "Sign Up" and 
										"Login" buttons guide new and returning users to the appropriate actions, enhancing user navigation. 
										The registration page is designed to make the onboarding process as smooth as possible,

									<h4>Create Category</h4>
									<p>
										This page empowers users to create and customize categories for logging various aspects of their lives, enhancing 
										both organization and insight. Users can create general topics such as "Study," "Dating," or any other area they wish to track. 
										This flexibility allows for a highly personalized logging experience tailored to individual needs and interests. By organizing logs into categories and counters, 
										users can better visualize patterns and trends in their data, facilitating deeper personal reflection and insight.

									<h4>Counters</h4>
									<p>
										This page allows users to create distinct counters within customizable categories. Within each category, 
										users can create specific counters to log particular activities. For example, in the "Workout" category, 
										users can create counters like "Leg Workouts" and increment the counter each time they complete 
										a leg workout session. Similarly, in the "Dating" category, users can set up counters for "Failed Dates" or 
										other dating experiences. Users can tap and hold a counter button to add a detailed note about the specific count. 
										This feature allows users to record additional information, such as thoughts, context, or specifics about the event, 
										along with the date. This enhances the depth of logging, making it more informative and valuable over time.

									<h4>Personal Data Tracker</h4>
									<p>
										The Data Page provides users with a visual breakdown of their logged data within each category. 
										The pie chart displays the percentage of each counter. The Data Page is designed as a place for reflection. 
										Users can review their logged data periodically, such as at the end of the year, to reflect on their 
										experiences, identify trends, and gain valuable insights into their behaviors and emotions over time. 
										The Data Page of JOT is a powerful tool that transforms logged data into meaningful insights.

							<h2 class="jot-section-title">Challenges</h2>
							<h2 style="text-align: center;">ðŸ˜¤</h2>
							<p>We embarked on the ambitious task of creating a full-stack app just a day after completing our final unit on the MERN stack. The challenge was immense: we had only two 
								days to develop a complete application featuring authorization, testing the API, and debuggingâ€”all as a team, right after finishing our intensive learning session.</p>
							<p>This rapid transition required us to absorb a vast amount of knowledge quickly, while also balancing the demands of a BootCamp project and a hackathon simultaneously.</p>
							<p>
								Despite the tight timeline and steep learning curve, our team's spirit and dedication were unwavering. 
								The major challenges we faced were managing our time effectively and adapting to new technologies quickly. 
								However, the strength of our teamwork and our commitment to hard work saw us through.

							<h2 class="jot-section-title">What's Next?</h2>

							<h4>Deployment on App Stores</h4>
							<p>To reach a wider audience, we plan to rework Jot into a React Native application. 
								This transition will allow us to deploy the app on both iOS and Android platforms, 
								making it easier for users to log their thoughts and emotions on the go. React Native's 
								robust framework will enable us to maintain a single codebase while delivering a high-performance, 
								native-like user experience on multiple platforms.</p>
							
							<h4>UI/UX Enhancements</h4>
							<p>With a deeper understanding of UX/UI design principles, we are committed to reworking 
								the user interface of Jot. Our aim is to create a more intuitive and visually 
								appealing experience that enhances user engagement.</p>
